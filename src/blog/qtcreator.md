This tutorial really does not bring anything new in the meaning of code. Basically we have copied
all source files from the [previous post](/blog/2015/03/20) and put them under `hw` and `src` folders.
But we also added one small file called `CMakefile.txt` that dramatically changes the way of how you think
about building C/C++ projects.


The good practice when you building CMake project is to create a separate build directory and
start cmake utility from there. This method is called “out of source build”. A significant
advantage of this method is that this way you keep intact all your source codes and all object
or temporary files will be created in a separate folder. As a side, for instance, you can use
Qt Creator during normal development workflow, but when, for some reason, you want to see the
raw output from build tools you can build the project from command-line.

# Building CMake projects using QtCreator

There are a lot of IDEs which you may use during this course. But, from our perspective, the
easiest one to set up will be Qt Creator. 


1. Download and install most recent distribuption of QtCreator using link http://www.qt.io/download/.
   After installation finished, run Qt Creator and navigate to `About Plugins…` menu.

2. In opened dialog “Installed Plugin” under `Device Support` section select `Bare Metal`
   plugin if it is not already selected.

3. Navigate to `Preferences/Devices` and click `Add…` button. Then in Device configuration
   Wizard select `Bare Metal Device` and hit `Start Wizard` button.

4. In the wizard dialog you need to type a few settings in.

   ![img04.png](/img/blog/qtcreator/img04.png)
   
   These are GDB Host which need to be set to `localhost`. GDB Port - `5022`.
   Initial script is a list of GDB commands which will be executed right after
   `arm-none-eabi-gdb` command connect to GdbServer. So for this project it will be
   ``` bash
   load %{DebuggedExecutable:FilePath}
   break reset_isr_handler
   ```
   The reason why break point is added to the script is because QtCreator automatically
   continues program execution upon startup.
   Reset commands script at this moment should be:
   ``` bash
   monitor reset halt
   ```
   You can change all of this settings later in `Preferences/Devices` dialog.

5. Navigate to `Build and Run/Debuggers` section and manually add `arm-none-eabi-gdb` executable
   to the list of available debuggers.

   ![Debuggers Tab](/img/blog/qtcreator/img05.png)

   Recent QtCreator versions, in order to make debugging work properly, require GDB been built
   with python scripting support. So you may need to use `arm-none-eabi-gdb-py` executable
   instead of `arm-none-eabi-gdb`.

6. Switch to “Compilers” tab and add new `arm-none-eabi-gcc` compiler as follows:

   ![Compilers Tab](/img/blog/qtcreator/img06.png)

7. Define new “Bare Metal Cortex-M” kit on the “Kits” tab.

   ![Kits Tab](/img/blog/qtcreator/img07.png)

   Despite that during this course we going to use CMake as our primary build system,
   specifying the compiler and Kit are required steps to make Qt Creator's debugging GUI
   feature works.
   You may also mark the newly added Kit as default one.

8. Navigate to “Open File or Project” menu and choose CMakeLists.txt in file browser.

   ![CMakefile.txt Open Dialog](/img/blog/qtcreator/img08.png)

9. Right after you have opened `CMakeFiles.txt` the `Run CMake` dialog will be shown.
   You have to provide at least one argument:
   ``` bash
   -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=~/projects/embedded-course/cmake-project/lm3s6965evb.cmake
   ```

   It tells to CMake which toolchain will be used during build process. If
   your `arm-none-eabi` installation is not on the `PATH`, then you can also add argument:
   ``` bash
   -DTOOLCHAIN_PATH=~/gcc-arm-none-eabi/bin/
   ```

   One more available option is `-DQEMU_PATH=` should point to a directory where
   your `qemu-system-arm` executable is located. For example:
   ``` bash
   -DQEMU_PATH=~/qemu-arm/bin
   ```
   ![Build Files Generation Process](/img/blog/qtcreator/img09.png)

   If you did everything correctly then executing CMake will produce necessary Make files
   under `cmake-project-build` directory. All build artefacts will be created in this
   directory as well.

10. By default Qt Creator sets `Qt Kit` for all imported CMake projects.
    Thus debugging will not work unless you set `Bare Metal Contex-M` kit as one to use within.
    In order to do this navigate to the `Project` tab and add the kit. You also may want to
    remove `Qt Kit` from project settings so it does not disturb you.

    ![Run Settings](/img/blog/qtcreator/img10.png)
    
    As you can see on the picture bellow, the run configuration is also has to be changed to
    `Run custom executable` and it executes `make run` command in a new terminal window.


From this point you can build and run the project in the same manner as you would do it with
any other type of projects.

![Make Execution](/img/blog/qtcreator/img11.png)


This screenshot illustrate the result of program execution.

Step which you need to take in order to setup debugging a little bit different. You need to
add to additional run configuration at first.

![Debug Configuration](/img/blog/qtcreator/img12.png)


Than you will need to manually start Qemu GdbServer. To make this step simpler a custom build
target was added to CMakeLists.txt which shapes correct command line and then executes
qemu-system-arm. So in a terminal you need to go to the “cmake-project-build” directory and
run following command:

``` bash
	make gdbserver
```


Unfortunately currently qemu-gdbserver does not support “monitor reset” command for Bare Metal targets,
so you will need to restart gdbserver every time you want to restart your debugging session.


And also please note that to gracefully terminate qemu you need to press CTRL-A X key sequence.
